## Overview

Welcome to **WOOF MATES** - the ultimate web application for dogs! Our app aims to provide a platform that respects and accommodates diverse perspectives of dog owners, by offering a range of criteria for connecting dogs, including breed, age, sex, and location, among others. Our goal is to connect dogs and their owners with similar interests and preferences, and foster long-lasting relationships.

With **WOOF MATES**, dog owners can easily create a profile for their pets, search for other dogs in their area, and "swipe" through potential matches based on various criteria. The app also allows users to set up playdates and connect with other dog owners in their community.

Our app is built using the latest technologies such as FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, ensuring fast and reliable performance. We have implemented robust data models to ensure data integrity, and have paid careful attention to the security of our app, so you can be sure your data is safe with us.

Whether you're a dog owner looking for a playmate for your furry friend or just want to connect with other dog lovers in your area, **WOOF MATES** has got you covered. Give it a try and let us help you find your perfect dog match!
